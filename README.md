 Dumb API Application

Simple JSON configured REST API with basic authentication for writing and websocket subscription support with rebroadcasting for realtime updates

Inintially created for CasparCG templates to subscribe to for unifided data updates across multiple html pages. So generic it can be used for plenty of stuff tho.

TODO
add auth for requests
